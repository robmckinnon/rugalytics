Rugalytics is a Ruby API for Google Analytics.

= Warning: API under development

The Rugalytics API is in early development so it may change slightly over time.
It should be in working order, so please give it a test spin! Sometimes
Google changes it's CSV export format, which can break Rugalytics. It's usually
fixed within a week of such occurrences.

The source code is hosted at github. Feel free to fork the code if you have
something to contribute:

 http://github.com/robmckinnon/rugalytics


== Install as a Gem

Should be up at rubyforge, so to install:

 sudo gem install rugalytics


== Authenticate

Login with your Google Analytics user name and password:

 require 'rubygems'
 require 'rugalytics'

 Rugalytics.login 'username', 'password'


== Obtain Profile

Get profile using account name and profile name:

 profile = Rugalytics.find_profile('your_site.com', 'blog.your_site.com')


If account name and profile name are the same:

 profile = Rugalytics.find_profile('your_site.com')


== Change Language Settings to English

At present your language setting for your Google Analytics account
must be set to English for Rugalytics to work.

 Google: Settings -> Language: choose UK English

 OR

 Google: Settings -> Language: choose US English


== Get Profile Summary Statistics

Obtaining page views:

 profile.pageviews # default period is one month ending today
 => 160600

 profile.pageviews :from=>'2007-01-01'
 => 2267550

 profile.pageviews :from=>'2007-01-01', :to=>'2007-01-02'
 => 24980

The +pageviews+ method is doing this under the hood:

 report = profile.pageviews_report :from=>'2007-01-01', :to=>'2007-01-02'

 report.pageviews_total
 => 16600

Using the report you can get +pageviews_by_day+:

 report.pageviews_by_day
 => [[Mon, 01 Jan 2007, 8200], [Tue, 02 Jan 2007, 8400]]

In the report, there is a +pageviews_graph+ containing the points:

 report.pageviews_graph.sum_of_points
 => 16600

 report.pageviews_graph.points_by_day
 => [[Mon, 01 Jan 2007, 8200], [Tue, 02 Jan 2007, 8400]]


== Lots of Reports!

The report name comes from the Google Analytics URL for a CSV report export.
The report name is the rpt parameter from the URL, e.g. 'Pageviews' or
'TrafficSources':

 https://www.google.com/analytics/reporting/export?fmt=2&...&&rpt=PageviewsReport&...
 https://www.google.com/analytics/reporting/export?fmt=2&...&&rpt=TrafficSourcesReport&...

If you are logged in to the Analytics website, you can find the CSV URL by
clicking on the Export tab, and then mousing over the CSV option.

To discover a list of report names, there's a method on profile:

 profile.report_names
 => ["ad_versions_report", "adwords_report", "all_sources_report",
     "average_pageviews_report", "bounce_rate_report", "browsers_report",
     "campaigns_report", "colors_report", "content_by_title_report",
     "content_drilldown_report", "content_report", "dashboard_report",
     "depth_of_visit_report", "direct_sources_report", "entrances_report",
     "exits_report", "flash_report", "geo_map_report", "hostnames_report",
     "java_report", "keyword_position_report", "keywords_report",
     "languages_report", "length_of_visit_report", "loyalty_report",
     "networks_report", "os_browsers_report", "pageviews_report",
     "platforms_report", "recency_report", "referring_sources_report",
     "resolutions_report", "search_engines_report", "speeds_report",
     "time_on_site_report", "top_content_detail_keywords_report",
     "top_content_detail_navigation_report", "top_content_detail_path_report",
     "top_content_detail_sources_report", "top_content_report",
     "traffic_sources_report", "unique_visitors_report",
     "visitor_types_report", "visitors_overview_report", "visits_report"]


== Load a Report

Let's load the TrafficSources report:

 report = profile.traffic_sources_report

 report.name
 => "Traffic Sources Overview"

 report.start_date
 => "28 May 2008"

 report.end_date
 => "4 June 2008"

 report.source_items.collect{|s| "#{s.sources}: #{s.visits}"}.first
 => "google (organic): 15210"

 report.keyword_items.collect{|k| "#{k.keywords}: #{k.visits}"}[1]
 => "oecd nz report summary 2007: 14"

Let's try another report, VisitorsOverview:

 report = profile.visitors_overview_report

 report.browser_items[1]
 => # Rugalytics::Item @percentage_visits="0.18", @visits="3140", @browser="Firefox"

 report.connection_speed_items[3]
 => # Rugalytics::Item @connection_speed="Dialup", @percentage_visits="0.06340057402849197", @visits="1100"

Let's now grab 100 lines of the Networks report:

 report = profile.networks_report :rows=>100

 report.items.size
 => 100

 report.items.first.network_location
 => "telecom xtra"


== Report by URL

Entrance search keywords by URL:

 report = profile.top_content_detail_keywords_report(:url=>'/projects/abc')
 report.name
 => "Entrance Keywords:,/projects/abc"

 report.items.collect{|i| "#{i.keyword} (#{i.unique_pageviews})"}
 => ["project abc (200)", "abc project (110)"]

Pageviews by URL:

 report = profile.top_content_detail_report(:url => "/projects/abc")
 report.name
 => "Content Detail:,/projects/abc"

 report.pageviews_total
 => 179

You can get a content drilldown report, for pages under a certain URL path:

 report = profile.content_drilldown_report(:url => "/projects/abc/")
 report.name
 => "Content Drilldown,/projects/abc/"

 report.items.first
 => # Rugalytics::Item @bounce_rate="0.85", @unique_pageviews="155",
          @percentage_exit="0.776536312849162", @time_on_page="165.75",
          @pageviews="179", @path="/reports/", @dollar_index="0.0",
          @url="http://your_site.com/projects/abc/reports/"

Pageviews by page title:

 report = profile.content_by_title_detail_report(:page_title => "Project ABC | Company XYZ")
 report.name
 => "Content by Title Detail:,Project ABC | Company XYZ"

 report.items.first
 => # Rugalytics::Item @bounce_rate="0.85", @unique_pageviews="1550",
          @percentage_exit="0.776536312849162", @time_on_page="165.75",
          @pageviews="179", @path="/projects/abc", @dollar_index="0.0",
          @url="http://your_site.com/projects/abc"


==Use in Rails

To use from Rails, make a config file rails_root/config/rugalytics.yml
with the following contents:

 ---
 account: your_account_name
 profile: your_profile_name
 username: your_user_name
 password: your_pass_w

Remember to tell your source control system to ignore this file! If you're
using git, this means adding config/rugalytics.yml to your .gitignore
file.

 vi .gitignore
 config/rugalytics.yml

You can now use Rugalytics from within Rails, and login will be done
automatically, e.g.:

 profile = Rugalytics.default_profile
 report = profile.top_content_report(:from=>(Date.today - 7) )
 top_items_over_week = report.items.sort_by{|i| i.unique_pageviews.to_i}.reverse

==Ruby Manor Presentation Slides - Nov 2008

Rugalytics - making a Ruby API to Google Analytics data - presentation slides from Ruby Manor 2008:
  http://www.slideshare.net/delineator/rugalytics-ruby-manor-nov-2008-presentation/


==Acknowledgements

Rugalytics started life as a fork of jnunemaker's Statwhore. As the code and
project scope began to diverge significantly from Statwhore, a new project was
initiated. Rugalytics makes use of the googlebase gem to login to Google.

Rugalytics makes use of the morph gem to emerge Ruby class definitions at
runtime based on the contents of the CSV reports from Google Analytics.
